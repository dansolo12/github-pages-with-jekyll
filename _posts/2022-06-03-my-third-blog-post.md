My third achivement is meeting the president of Rutgers. I had a lengthy conversation with President Holloway and his wife. We talked about Rutgers and my future college plans. My brother and I ate at his house. We ate turkey, mac and cheese, and veggies. The food tasted very good and I felt very accomplished to meet President Holloway.
