My second accomplishment is having an A in biology honors. Biology honors was a very difficult class that I doubted I would even be able to get a B in. However, I worked very hard, did not skip a single textbook reading and I got an A in the class. I remember getting a 74 on the midterm and thinking that I don't have a shot at an A. However, I persevered and achieved a grand achievment.
